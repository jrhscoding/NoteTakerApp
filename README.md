# NoteTakerApp
  ## Description 
  This project we were tasked to create a back end and connect it to the provided front end to ensure a fully functioning app. This was made possible using node, express, fs, and path. We used a hardcoded database file and used fs to write to the file. This was a challenging project and one of my biggest challenges was deploying to heroku.

  The requirements were as follows.
  GIVEN a note-taking application
  WHEN I open the Note Taker
  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
  WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
  HEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
  WHEN I click on the Save icon
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
  THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
  WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
 THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
